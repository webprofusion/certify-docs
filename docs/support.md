## Support for Licensed Customers

Our products are ideal for organisations or professionals who need tools with dependable support. _You are encouraged to test out the software yourself as an evaluation before purchasing as not all usage scenarios will be supported._

**Full time support is available via email support tickets for registered users (or those who are evaluating the software).** You can register for the Professional or Enterprise editions via https://certifytheweb.com/upgrade/. To create a new support request for help or for general questions, email **support at certifytheweb.com**, including details of your licensed email address, describing the problem/question in detail with any supporting information you can provide.

- Please include how to recreate the problem and any special configuration you may have. 
- Logs for managed certificates can be found on the Status tab of each managed certificate. 
- Domain details shared with us via support are treated as confidential and there is no need to redact domains in logs etc (redacting domains can make issue diagnosis more difficult).

Support operates weekdays (Australian Western Standard Time) with some coverage on weekends. Telephone support and general consultancy is not currently available but we will try to help where we can for all questions.
