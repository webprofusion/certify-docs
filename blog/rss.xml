            <description><![CDATA[Learn the fundamentals of automated SSL/TLS certificate management and why it's essential for modern infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your certificates are essential for securing web traffic, APIs, and internal communications. Manually managing certificates across multiple servers and applications can be time-consuming, error-prone, and increasingly impractical as certificate lifetimes continue to shrink.</p>
<p>This article introduces the fundamentals of certificates and certificate management automation and explains why it's becoming essential for modern infrastructure.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-automate-certificate-management">Why Automate Certificate Management?<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#why-automate-certificate-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Automate Certificate Management?" title="Direct link to Why Automate Certificate Management?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Manual certificate management worked when certificates had longer lifetimes, but the landscape is rapidly changing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shorter Certificate Lifetimes</strong>: Let's Encrypt currently issues 90-day certificates, and there's industry movement toward even shorter lifetimes (potentially 47 days in the future)</li>
<li><strong>Scale Challenges</strong>: Managing dozens or hundreds of certificates manually becomes unmanageable</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Downtime</strong>: Automated renewal eliminates the risk of expired certificates causing service outages</li>
<li><strong>Security Benefits</strong>: Fresh certificates with shorter lifetimes reduce the window of vulnerability if a private key is compromised</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting your automation journey now prepares you for the future of certificate management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-the-certificate-lifecycle">Understanding the Certificate Lifecycle<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#understanding-the-certificate-lifecycle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the Certificate Lifecycle" title="Direct link to Understanding the Certificate Lifecycle" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Certificate management automation involves three main phases:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-certificate-ordering-and-validation">1. Certificate Ordering and Validation<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#1-certificate-ordering-and-validation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Certificate Ordering and Validation" title="Direct link to 1. Certificate Ordering and Validation" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is a public or internal entity which issues certificates. Public CAs issue trusted certificates. That trust happens because your OS/browser already knows and trusts their root issuing certificate via OS/software updates (and in turn any intermediate issuer they have signed using that root).</p>
<p>Automated certificate management can use various technologies but the most commonly used is the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) standard: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC8555</a></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wait-what-is-a-certificate-though">Wait, what is a certificate though?<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#wait-what-is-a-certificate-though" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wait, what is a certificate though?" title="Direct link to Wait, what is a certificate though?" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>A certificate is an assurance by an issuer (the CA) that the entity that requested the cert (and held a specific private key, which is a secret chunk of data only your system knows) was verifiably in control of the identifiers included as subjects in the certificate details, at the time the cert was issued.</p>
<p>A cert typically contains a set (Subject Alternative Names or SAN) of identifiers which can be domains, IP addresses etc) and the public key that corresponds to your private key.</p>
<p>When using a cert you need your private key and the cert in combination, this is then loaded by the service that uses the certificate to begin the TLS (transport layer security) conversation. The client (browser etc) on the other end of the conversation already trusts the root certificates of the CA via OS updates or other "trust store" certificate distribution.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="domain-validation">Domain Validation<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#domain-validation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Domain Validation" title="Direct link to Domain Validation" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>CAs like Let's Encrypt, Google Trust Services, and traditional commercial CAs require proof that you control the domains included in your certificate. This validation typically happens through:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Domain Validation</strong>: The CA checks for a specific file or response at a well-known URL on your domain. Automation tools can handle this by temporarily serving the required response.</p>
<p><strong>DNS Domain Validation</strong>: The CA looks for a specific TXT record in your domain's DNS. Modern certificate management tools can automatically update DNS records through provider APIs, making this method ideal for internal services or when HTTP validation isn't feasible.</p>
<p>Modern certificate management systems can support multiple CA accounts and the best ones even provide automatic fallback strategies if your preferred CA experiences issues.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-certificate-storage-and-distribution">2. Certificate Storage and Distribution<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#2-certificate-storage-and-distribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Certificate Storage and Distribution" title="Direct link to 2. Certificate Storage and Distribution" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Once obtained, certificates need to be securely stored and made available to the applications that need them. This typically involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Certificate Stores</strong>: On Windows, this means the machine certificate store</li>
<li><strong>File-based Storage</strong>: PFX archives or PEM files for cross-platform compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Secrets Management</strong>: Integration with services like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-deployment-and-application-integration">3. Deployment and Application Integration<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#3-deployment-and-application-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Deployment and Application Integration" title="Direct link to 3. Deployment and Application Integration" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>This is often the most complex phase, as every application has its own way of consuming certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IIS Integration</strong>: Windows IIS can use certificate store bindings or Centralized Certificate Store</li>
<li><strong>File-based Applications</strong>: Many applications read certificates from specific file paths</li>
<li><strong>API-based Updates</strong>: Some services accept certificate updates through REST APIs</li>
<li><strong>Service Restarts</strong>: Some applications require restart after certificate updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally some applications or appliances require using their own private keys for certificate signing requests (CSRs), or require key re-use for Certificate Pinning (trusts a specific set of certificate public keys).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deployment-strategies">Deployment Strategies<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#deployment-strategies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deployment Strategies" title="Direct link to Deployment Strategies" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="built-in-integration-tasks">Built-in Integration Tasks<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#built-in-integration-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Built-in Integration Tasks" title="Direct link to Built-in Integration Tasks" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Modern certificate management tools can provide various levels of built-in support for common scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Servers</strong>: IIS, Apache, Nginx</li>
<li><strong>Mail Servers</strong>: MS Exchange etc</li>
<li><strong>Secrets Vaults</strong>: Store certificates as secrets for other apps and services to consume</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Services</strong>: Integration with cloud provider certificate services</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-deployment-tasks">Custom Deployment Tasks<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#custom-deployment-tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom Deployment Tasks" title="Direct link to Custom Deployment Tasks" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For unique environments, mature automation tools typically offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Export Tasks</strong>: Convert certificates to various formats (PEM, PFX etc)</li>
<li><strong>File Copy Operations</strong>: Deploy certificates over UNC shares or SSH</li>
<li><strong>Scripting Integration</strong>: PowerShell, Bash, or other scripting languages for custom logic</li>
<li><strong>API Calls</strong>: Update configuration or send notifications through REST APIs or other interfaces</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="progressive-automation">Progressive Automation<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#progressive-automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Progressive Automation" title="Direct link to Progressive Automation" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>You don't need to automate everything at once. A typical progression might be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Manual Export</strong>: Start by automating certificate acquisition, then manually deploy during maintenance windows</li>
<li><strong>Automated Export</strong>: Set up automatic export to shared locations where applications can find updated certificates</li>
<li><strong>Full Automation</strong>: Implement automatic deployment and service updates. Consider monitoring deployment to ensure what you think is deployed is actually working.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deployment-types">Deployment Types<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/certificate-automation-intro#deployment-types" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deployment Types" title="Direct link to Deployment Types" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Services that secure communication using TLS reference certificates in a variety of way. Deploying your cert to them requires knowing how the service loads/selects the certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thumbprints</strong>: On Windows a cert is commonly stored in the local machine certificate store and referenced by applications using the "Thumbprint" value, this is usually the SHA1 hash of the certificate details, which changes with each renewal even if the same private key is reused.</li>
<li><strong>PFX</strong>: This is an archive format also known as PKCS#12 or .p12, most popular on Windows. It contains your cert, intermediate issuers (but not the root), and the private key. The private key can optionally be password protected.</li>
<li><strong>PEM</strong>: Certificates can be split into component files with the primary ("leaf" or "end-entity") certificate and the private key in PEM encoded (base64) text files. These are commonly used for apps that are not native to Windows, or on Linux services etc where PFX/.p12 is less frequently encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deploying a cert can variously involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating a thumbprint value on a port binding, file or registry key (typical on Windows).</li>
<li>Copying cert files to a specific location, in specific formats.</li>
<li>Restarting/reloading services so they pick up the latest cert.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before implementing certificate automation, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inventory Your Certificates</strong>: Document all certificates currently in use and their renewal deployment methods</li>
<li><strong>Assess Application Requirements</strong>: Understand how each application consumes certificates</li>
<li><strong>Network Access</strong>: Ensure your automation tool can reach all target systems, or target systems can pull the latest cert regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Security Boundaries</strong>: Plan for deployment across different security zones or networks</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Alerting</strong>: Implement monitoring to detect renewal failures or deployment issues</li>
</ol>

<p>The complexity of certificate automation varies greatly depending on your environment, but the key is to start simple and gradually expand your automation coverage. Modern tools like Certify Certificate Manager make it easy to begin with basic scenarios and progressively add more sophisticated deployment tasks as your needs grow.</p>
<p>The goal is to transform certificate management from a manual, error-prone task into a reliable, automated process that enhances both security and operational efficiency.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[ACME profiles draft implementation]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have implement support for the ACME Profiles extension, a new feature designed to enhance the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. This extension allows ACME Servers to offer a selection of different certificate profiles to ACME Clients, making it easier for clients to request the specific type of certificate they need.</p>
<p>ACME Profiles are a new proposed extension to the ACME standard allows CAs to offer certificates with different features depending on user preferences.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/</a></p>
<p>This feature will be available in the next major release of Certify Certificate Manager and Certify Management Hub.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-acme-profiles">What are ACME Profiles?<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#what-are-acme-profiles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are ACME Profiles?" title="Direct link to What are ACME Profiles?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>ACME Profiles provide a way for Certificate Authorities (CAs) to advertise the different types of certificates they can issue. For example, a CA might offer a certificate with a shorter lifetime and different key usage constraints. By selecting a profile, clients can ensure they receive a certificate that meets their specific requirements.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-features">Key Features<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#key-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features" title="Direct link to Key Features" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>ACME Profiles make it easier for CAs to introduce new and improved certificate types. Clients can quickly adopt these new profiles without needing to change their existing workflows or configurations.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="enhanced-security">Enhanced Security<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#enhanced-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Security" title="Direct link to Enhanced Security" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>By moving profile selection out of the CSR and into the ACME protocol, ACME Profiles reduce the risk of compliance incidents caused by incorrect or malicious CSR values. This helps ensure that certificates are issued according to the CA's policies and standards.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works">How It Works<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How It Works" title="Direct link to How It Works" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>ACME Servers that support profiles will include a new <code>profiles</code> field in their Directory object. This field lists the available profiles and provides human-readable descriptions or URLs to documentation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="client-requests">Client Requests<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#client-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Client Requests" title="Direct link to Client Requests" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When creating a new Order, clients can specify the desired profile in the <code>profile</code> field of the Order object. The server will then issue a certificate that matches the selected profile.</p>
<p>In <strong>Certify Certificate Manager</strong> and <strong>Certify Management Hub</strong> this will be available as an option under under <em>Certificate &gt; Advanced &gt; Certificate Authority</em>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-implementations">Current Implementations<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#current-implementations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Implementations" title="Direct link to Current Implementations" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Let's Encrypt's Boulder ACME Server software fully implements the ACME Profiles extension. Although profiles are not yet configured in Let's Encrypt's Production and Staging environments, the Pebble ACME Server testbed also supports this extension.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://docs.certifytheweb.com/blog/acme-profiles-draft#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The ACME Profiles extension is a significant step forward in providing flexibility and preferences in automated certificate management. By allowing clients to select predefined profiles, it reduces complexity, enhances security, and provides greater flexibility for both clients and CAs.</p>
<p>We encourage you to explore the ACME Profiles feature when it becomes available and provide feedback to help us continue improving this important protocol.</p>]]></content:encoded>
